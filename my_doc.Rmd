# Victoria's amazing Markdown document

## Words
A paragraph of words, many many words. 

## Numbers
Look some code!

```{r}
# I am making some new data
x <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
y <- rnorm(100, 3, 1)
```

And a plot
```{r}
# plot the data
plot(x, y)
```

Change the plot colours
```{r}
plot(x, y, col="red")
```

Because you deserve it
